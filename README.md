ML Predicting Boston Housing Prices
Created as part of the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree.
The project uses Python version 2.6


In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts.

The goals of this project is to illustrate how to use basic techincs to prepare a dataset so it can be feed to a prediction model, how to analyze the dataset statistics properties, how to measure the performance of model and finally the fundamental concepts behind prediction models such as Linear Regression and Decision Trees.
